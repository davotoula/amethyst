## Privacy and Information Permanence

Relays know your IP address, your name, your location (guessed from IP), your pub key, all your contacts, and other relays, and can read every action you do (post, like, boost, quote, report, etc) except for Private Zaps and Private DMs. While the content of direct messages (DMs) is only visible to you and your DM counterparty, everyone can see when you and your counterparty DM each other.

If you want to improve your privacy, consider utilizing a service that masks your IP address (e.g. a VPN or Tor) from trackers online.

The relay also learns which public keys you are requesting, meaning your public key will be tied to your IP address.

Information shared on Nostr can be re-broadcasted to other servers and should be assumed permanent for privacy purposes. There is no way to guarantee the deletion of any content once posted.

# Development Overview

This repository is split between Amethyst and Quartz:
- Amethyst is a native Android app made with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.
- Quartz is our own Nostr-commons library to host classes that are of interest to other Nostr Clients.

The app architecture consists of the UI, which uses the usual State/ViewModel/Composition, the service layer that connects with Nostr relays,
and the model/repository layer, which keeps all Nostr objects in memory, in a full OO graph.

The repository layer stores Nostr Events as Notes and Users separately. Those classes use LiveData and Flow objects to
allow the UI and other parts of the app to subscribe to each Note/User and receive updates when they happen.
They are also responsible for updating viewModels when needed. As the user scrolls through Events, the Datasource classes
are updated to receive more information about those particular Events.

Most of the UI is reactive to changes in the repository classes. The service layer assembles Nostr filters for each need of the app,
receives the data from the Relay, and sends it to the repository. Connection with relays is never closed during the use of the app.
The UI receives a notification that objects have been updated. Instances of User and Notes are mutable directly.
There will never be two Notes with the same ID or two User instances with the same pubkey.

Lastly, the user's account information (private key/pub key) is stored in the Android KeyStore for security.

## Setup

Make sure to have the following pre-requisites installed:
1. Java 17+
2. Android Studio
3. Android 8.0+ Phone or Emulation setup

Fork and clone this repository and import it into Android Studio
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vitorpamplona/amethyst.git
```

Use an Android Studio build action to install and run the app on your device or a simulator.

## Building
Build the app:
```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

## Testing
```bash
./gradlew test
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
```

## Linting
```bash
./gradlew spotlessCheck
./gradlew spotlessApply
```

## Installing on device

For the F-Droid build:
```bash
./gradlew installFdroidDebug
```

For the Play build:
```bash
./gradlew installPlayDebug
```

## Deploying

1. Generate a new signing key
```
keytool -genkey -v -keystore <my-release-key.keystore> -alias <alias_name> -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
openssl base64 < <my-release-key.keystore> | tr -d '\n' | tee some_signing_key.jks.base64.txt
```
2. Create four Secret Key variables on your GitHub repository and fill in the signing key information
    - `KEY_ALIAS` <- `<alias_name>`
    - `KEY_PASSWORD` <- `<your password>`
    - `KEY_STORE_PASSWORD` <- `<your key store password>`
    - `SIGNING_KEY` <- the data from `<my-release-key.keystore>`
3. Change the `versionCode` and `versionName` on `amethyst/build.gradle`
4. Commit and push.
5. Tag the commit with `v{x.x.x}`
6. Let the [Create Release GitHub Action](https://github.com/vitorpamplona/amethyst/actions/workflows/create-release.yml) build a new `aab` file.
7. Add your CHANGE LOG to the description of the new release
8. Download the `aab` file and upload it to the PlayStore.

## Using the Quartz library

Setup [JitPack.io](https://jitpack.io/#vitorpamplona/amethyst/v0.84.3) to your build file

Add `maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }` to settings.gradle at the end of repositories:

```gradle
dependencyResolutionManagement {
  repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
  }
}
```

Add the dependency

```gradle
implementation('com.github.vitorpamplona.amethyst:quartz:v0.85.1')
```
